# Re-Polished

A reimplementation of the great [Polished](https://polished.js.org/) library in idiomatic [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/en/) with following goals:
- Provide well designed data types for color manipulation
- Implement most of the color manipulation functions etc. with familiar names from Polished in platform agnostic ReasonML.
- Offer a binding layer for [Bs-Css](https://github.com/reasonml-labs/bs-css) for easier use with it on web platform (Bucklescript)

Supported functions
- darken
- opacify
- readable
- transparentize
